        "This assignment is inspired and adopted from the Deep Learning Lab from Vicente Ordonez's course on Language and Vision at the University of Virginia. The first two parts of this notebook are taken nearly verbatim from his lab. Section 1 is provided for you and implements a single-layer supervised neural network; no coding is required for Section 1. Section 2 and Section 3 are the ones where you need to code the solutions and provide answers to questions. Section 4 is designed to introduce you to PyTorch and, more importantly, introduce you to key debugging strategies when dealing with training of neural networks. \n",

        "After computing the output predictions $\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}$ it is necessary to compare these against the true values of $\\mathbf{y}$. Let's call these true, correct, or desired values $\\mathbf{y}$. Typically, a simple loss or cost function is used to measure the degree by which the prediction $\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}$ is wrong with respect to $\\mathbf{y}$. A common loss function for regression is the sum of squared differences between the prediction and its true value. Assuming a prediction $\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}^{(d)}$ for our training sample $\\mathbf{x}^{(d)}$ with true value $\\mathbf{y}^{(d)}$, then the loss can be computed as:\n",

This would in turn ensure that predictions $\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}$ are as similar as possible to the true values $\\mathbf{y}$. To achieve this we need to minimize the following function:\n",
